      "text" : "During my 4th year in Dublin, I worked as a freelance on a two-day-a-week schedule for the company <a href='https://www.neolink.link/' target=_blank>Neolink</a>. <br><br>My main mission was to carry out a complete overhaul of a first version of an agenda for the <i>NeoGestion</i> product using <a href='https://fullcalendar.io/' target=_blank>FullCalendar</a>. To develop this agenda in an <strong>agile</strong> way, I collaborated with a <strong>designer</strong> and a <strong>project manager</strong> who was in direct contact with the client.<br><br>The main challenge of this project was to have the most <strong>optimized</strong> agenda possible for scheduling appointments, easy and quick event management. It was also necessary to develop an <strong>algorithm</strong> to facilitate the scheduling of appointments."
