      "text" : "<i>My Image Compressor</i> was developed during the 2nd year of <a href='https://www.epitech.eu/' target=_blanc>Epitech</a>. The goal was to create an image compressor using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering' target=_blanc>k-means clustering</a> algorithm.<br><br> In our case, the program receives a list of <strong>pixels</strong> and a number <strong>K</strong> that corresponds to the final number of colors. <br> The lower the <strong>K</strong>, the more the image is compressed.<br><br> By grouping each pixel in the most appropriate <i>cluster</i> based on <strong>color</strong> and <strong>position</strong>, the image is modified while maintaining the best possible quality."
