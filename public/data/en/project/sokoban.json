      "text" : "This project was completed in the first year of <a href='https://www.epitech.eu/' target=_blank>Epitech</a>.<br><br>Sokoban is a type of transport puzzle, in which a player pushes <strong>boxes</strong> in a <strong>warehouse</strong> in an attempt to move them to <strong>storage locations</strong>.<br><br>The game is played on a grid of squares, where each square is either a <strong>floor</strong> or a <strong>wall</strong>. Some floor squares contain boxes and others are marked as storage locations.<br><br>The player is confined to the grid and can move <strong>horizontally</strong> or <strong>vertically</strong> on empty squares (never through walls or boxes).<br><br>The player can also enter a box, which pushes it into the next square.<br><br>Boxes cannot be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled.<br><br>The puzzle is <strong>solved</strong> when all boxes are at storage locations."
